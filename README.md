# DIGG-Module11-TheScribe
Dalia Gomez - Module 11 Challenge: Express.js, The Scribe.

## Description
The purpose of this challenge was to create an application called Note Taker to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end, while saving and retrieving notes data from JSON files.

 The starter code already included the application's front end, being the focus of this challenge the creation of its back end, connecting the two of them. The application was then deployed to Render.
